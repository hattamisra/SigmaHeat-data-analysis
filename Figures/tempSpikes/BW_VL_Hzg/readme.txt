The name indicates the threshold temperature, then the threshold difference. So, BW_RL_Hzg_22_0point1 indicates that the data includes only periods with peaks of 22 degrees C or higher, and a difference of at least 0.1 degrees C between the max and min

Most of these take a look at the data divided into 6 min periods, except for the plot with filename BW_VL_Hzg_21_0point1_15min_periods, which (naturally) tries to detect peaks using 15 minute periods.
